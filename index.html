                    I'm a Cloud Engineer for DICK'S Sporting Goods who is driven to solve the hard problems and adapt to a fast-paced and ever changing environment.
                    I strive to create and support systems that not only function efficiently under the hood, but also are stable and scalable for consistent future use.
                    I am always looking forward to the next iteration of faster more efficient technology with custom PC building a favourite past-time.
                    When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably hiking, skiing, hammocking, managing musical productions, or getting lost in a novel.

                            Autolab is a course management service, initially developed by a team of students at Carnegie Mellon University and University at Buffalo, 
                            that enables instructors to offer autograded programming assignments to their students over the Web. The two key ideas in Autolab are autograding, 
                            that is, programs evaluating other programs, and scoreboards. Autolab also provides other services that instructors expect in a course management system, 
                            including gradebooks, rosters, handins/handouts, lab writeups, code annotation, manual grading, late penalties, grace days, cheat checking, 
                            meetings, partners, and bulk emails. I am currently leading the development team at University at Buffalo as well as conducting the release engineering

                        <p class="info"><em class="date">Aug 2016 – Jan 2017</em></p>

                            The recent 802.11n standard introduces a variety of mechanisms at the PHY and MAC layers (more aggressive modulation and coding schemes,
                            frame aggregation, channel bonding, short guard interval) offering wireless bitrates as high as 600 Mbps, longer range, and more reliable
                            coverage than legacy 802.11a/b/g networks. The more recent 802.11ac standard (currently in draft status) further pushes the envelope promising
                            bitrates up to 1 Gbps. However, improved communication speeds generally come at the cost of higher energy consumption. This concern is particularly
                            heightened for smartphones, where radio interfaces can account for up to 50% of the total power budget under typical use. It thus becomes critical
                            to understand the performance-power tradeoffs in 802.11n/ac equipped smartphones in order to help designers utilize 802.11n/ac chipsets in an energy
                            efficient manner without sacrificing performance. We used UDP traffic over perfect wireless links trying to measure the maximum possible performance.
                            The goal of this project was to focus on the tradeoffs introduced by rate adaptation algorithms. Specifically, we investigated whether rate adaptation
                            algorithms are (i) effective, i.e., by selecting the highest performance rate, and (ii) energy-efficient, i.e., by selecting the most-energy efficient
                            rate for a given data traffic.

                            Developed an Operating System over the course of a semester by implementing smaller subsystems and integrating them into the overall project once they
                            were proven to be stable. The subsystems consisted of: Synchronization Primitives - mutex locks, semaphores, conditional variables, and reader/writer locks;
                            File System Calls and Process Support - read, write, close, lseek, dup2, chdir ,exec, fork, waitpid to support user level programs; Virtual Memory -
                            address translation, TLB management, page replacement, and swapping. This project had intense design components as the assignments were broad in the sense
                            that the students could approach the issue in entirely new and creative ways. The OS contains no memory leaks and was stable in withstanding rigorous testing
                            by the course staff. More info can be found here: <a href="https://test161.ops-class.org/leaders" target="_blank">ops-class.org</a>
